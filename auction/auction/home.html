        <h1> HISTORY OF IPL</h1>
        <p> The IPL auction has evolved significantly since its inception in 2008. The inaugural auction saw MS Dhoni becoming the costliest player at $1.5 million for Chennai Super Kings, while teams had a $5 million budget cap, and some players like Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly were assigned as icon players without auction. Subsequent years introduced mini-auctions for player additions, with notable buys like Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen in 2009. Major transformations occurred in 2011 during the first mega auction, with teams rebuilding their squads after a three-year cycle. The IPL retained its dynamic format by introducing marquee players, allowing uncapped players in auctions, and periodically expanding budgets to accommodate the league's growing financial scale. Over the years, auctions have witnessed record-breaking bids, such as Yuvraj Singh in 2015 and Ben Stokes in 2023, reflecting the franchises' strategies and player performances. These auctions not only determine team rosters but also shape the competitive landscape of each IPL season.
